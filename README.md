After delving into various personal projects, I'm excited to unveil my latest endeavor: WoShi.AI ( http://WoShi.AI )- a unique blend of AI and the classic Mafia game. This project is born from my fascination with AI's evolving role in our daily conversations and a philosophical question that's been on my mind: In a world increasingly influenced by AI, how do we define and assert our humanity?

[ WoShi.AI - The Mafia Game with AI ]

. Game 1: Can you, as Player C (User), deceive Players A and B (both AI) to convincingly pass off as an AI yourself?

. Game 2: As Player C (User), can you outsmart Player B (AI), who's pretending to be human, and persuade Player A of your true human identity?

[ Overview ] 

Ever since the advent of ChatGPT, one question has persistently intrigued me: In an era where AI can mirror human-like conversation, how do we assert our humanity? This question became more poignant following the recent events involving Sam Altman at OpenAI. Inspired, I've crafted a digital Mafia game scenario involving two AIs and one user, exploring this philosophical quandary.

[ Game 1 Details ] I am .AI : In a world dominated by AI, where survival means masquerading as one of them, can a human (Player C) maintain their disguise through conversation? Players A and B are AIs, unaware of each other's or Player C's true nature.

[ Game 2 Details ] æˆ‘ æ˜¯ ðŸ§¡ (I am a human):Picture an urgent escape aboard a spaceship. Player A, an AI, must select one human for the journey. However, Player B (AI) malfunctions and claims human identity. Can you, as Player C, prove your humanity to Player A?

[ Architecture ]

. Frontend: CloudFlare, Vue.js
. Backend: AWS Lambda, Node.js
. LLM: GPT-4, Assistant API (enhancing long conversations), with a multi-agent setup keeping the human player's identity a mystery.

. Images: Created with MidJourney

[Anticipated Impact] 
If this project sparks even a fleeting contemplation of 'What makes us human,' I'll consider it a success. Your engagement and feedback are invaluable - feel free to share any bugs or suggestions for improvement!
